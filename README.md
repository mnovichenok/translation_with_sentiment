#  Sentiment-Controlled French-to-English Translator
A full-stack web application that translates French sentences into English with a specified sentiment.

## Overview
This project allows users to input a sentence in French and choose an English sentiment (i.e., neutral, joy, anger, sadness, surprise, fear, disgust) for the translation. It uses a fine-tuned T5 model to generate translations in the selected emotional tone. The application is built with:


- Hugging Face models:

  - [`j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base`](https://huggingface.co/j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base) for sentiment labeling (used during training)

  - A custom fine-tuned T5 model for sentiment-aware translation

- FastAPI backend handles inference using Hugging Face Transformers

- React frontend for clean user interaction

- Containerized with Podman using podman-compose for easy deployment
